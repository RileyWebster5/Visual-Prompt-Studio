Visual prompt studio phase 2.1
Prompt A: Create an artwork that uses water color and emphasizes movement from the water, a grainy texture, contrast of bright colors, and different shapes to make the piece unique. Use crosshatching and the wet-on-wet technique characteristic of this medium. The composition should feature a brightly colored car in a city full of vibrant colors and unique shapes. Vocabulary breakdown: Water color- a painting method using pigments suspended in a water-based, gum arabic binder, applied to paper to create translucent, luminous, and fluid artwork. Crosshatching- a drawing and shading technique that uses layers of perpendicular or closely spaced intersecting parallel lines to create value, depth, and texture. 
Prompt B: Create an artwork that uses engraving and emphasizes thin and thick lines, stippling to create value, contrast and depth. Use a laser engraver for this medium. The composition should feature a brightly colored car in a city full of vibrant colors and unique shapes. Vocabulary breakdown: Engraving- a precise, historic intaglio printmaking technique where an artist uses a sharp tool, called a burin, to cut lines directly into a metal plate. Stippling- an art technique that creates images, textures, and shading using only small, distinct dots. Laser engraving- a precise, non-contact, computer-guided process that uses a concentrated beam of light to vaporize material, creating intricate, permanent, and often 3D, high-contrast, or textured designs.
